* Training focuses
** Throwing
- Consistent practice throughout season
- Favour clinical, direct throws
- Move away from "into space throws"

** Cutting
- Controlling/manipulating opponent through positioning and movement
- Timing, generation, space creation
- Speed variation

** Defense
- Controlling/manipulating opponent to acheive outcomes/field position
- First phase of mark straighter, transitioning to harder around mark + downfield adjustment
- Look to play brackety/switchy/smart style, in an active (not reactive) way
- Aim to apply team pressure
- Break down positions into smaller jobs (ie, job is to push players out of specific space, rather than mark player 69. Idea is to allow mixed matchups and more flexibility)

** Additional
- Positive inner team dialogue (mistakes acceptable during training, no head down mentality, etc.)
- How do we think about other teams? Rather than "that fancy American team" we should be thinking about breaking them down. What jobs and roles do we need to control and manipulate their offense or defence? What can we exploit?
- Visualisation as a training tool

* Standard warmup
** Part 1 Pysical warmup
- 50% run
- Backward run, large steps
- 50% run
- Backward skip
- Casual skips
- Low intensity shuffle changing side every 4 steps
** Part 2 Mobility

** Part 3 Nervous system

| 20 min | Mini, successful break throw during point = 1 bonus point |

- Throwing set similar to 100 throws (10 Flat BH, 10 IO BH, 10 OI BH, 10 Flat flick...). First 5 throws from static/neutral position. Second 5 with a fake then throw. Before session, each player to decide focus for throws (balanced pivot, increase disc spin, eyes up looking at receiver, etc.)
- Three point mark drill: Lay out a cone for the thrower/marker and two cones for receivers both 45-90 degrees from each other (start tight and increase to make more difficult). The goal is for the marker to prevent the thrower from throwing to either receiver (for a stall of 10). If receiver has to move outside cone to catch the mark is successful. Receivers replaced by trees/poles/cones if you don't have 4 people.

* Goals/motivations [24/24]
1. What are you hoping to get out of the experience on a personal
   level/why did you sign up?
2. What are you hoping for on a team level/what do you want success
   for the team to look like?

3. From now until April the plan is to hold one WUCC training a week
   (knowing that everyone will also be training a couple of times a
   week with their nationals clubs). To help manage workload/recovery
   these will likely be short, focused sessions, probably 60 minutes.
   For players that can't attend (living outside God's country) do you
   have any ideas on what your training might look like? Would it be
   helpful for me to send out a quick write up of the session each
   week for you to adapt it? Any ideas on how we can include out of
   towners in training? This is something I think will be a challenge,
   but it important to get right, so keen to hear ideas.
4. Not planning to prescribe any fitness/strength training, with the
   expectation that people understand their own bodies and how to
   manage this aspect of training. That being said, I have access to
   professionally developed ulti specific training programs for both
   gym and conditioning/fitness. If you'd like some guidance or help
   setting up a program in this area let me know.
5. Will you be there for this weekend's training camp (8-9th Jan)?
   11am-4pm Sat, 10:30-4pm Sun, I'll send out a schedule in the next
   few days.
6. Finally, anything that might be relevent for me to know (current
   injuries, only playing if you don't get a call up from the crocs,
   anecdotes, interesting jokes)? Will remain confidential where
   required
** DONE Abby
1. I signed up to this team because I’ve always wanted to go to WUCC
   and the team I had somewhat committed to (Phoenix of HoS) that was
   trying to get to WUCC decided not to go. I then played for this
   team at the ACT Championships and had lots of fun. In the past two
   years, I’ve made two national teams (U20 womens and U24 mixed) but
   neither competed at worlds so I’m excited to finally compete
   overseas. I’m hoping to learn how to better train and prepare for
   elite competition, both in terms of fitness and skill development.
2. On a team level, I want success to look like everyone focussing and
   working hard at trainings, and keeping up individual fitness and
   ideally throwing everyday to gain consistency between trainings. At
   the tournament, I want the team to do their very best, to keep
   spirits high which in turn aids with team flow, for everyone to
   know what they are supposed to be doing, and to keep having fun.

3. As I live in Melbourne, I won’t be able to attend weekly trainings.
   I will however plan to make any and all the training camps run. I
   would greatly appreciate if you would send out quick write ups of
   each session so I can at least somewhat keep up with what the rest
   of the team is doing. On top of that, I will be training for Spicy
   Chilly and doing at least one weekly pod for them and I’ve been
   throwing everyday for a couple of weeks to increase my throwing
   range and consistency. I will also be rejoining the gym as soon as
   I can find the best deal for my money to continue proper strength
   and conditioning. To try and include out-of-towners, something
   simple that could be done is asking everyone to post a selfie or
   pic after they’ve podded or trained. That at least fosters some
   feelings of togetherness and that everyone else is training (if not
   literally) with you.
4. I think I might be able to manage with a program I had going
   pre/early COVID but I may want some guidance with setting up a
   better program at some point.
5. I have already booked my flights to and from so yes I will
   definitely be there this weekend.
6. I have a chronically dodgy right thumb (hyperextended it like 4
   years ago then got the wrong rehab for it so it never healed
   properly) but that allowed me to learn how to throw left handed
   (I’ve been working on that recently so I can confuse my defense at
   some point hopefully).
I hope this helps somewhat!
** DONE Taylor
1. keen to level up, work hard with a team to achieve a goal.
2. I think we should set ourselves a target of top 20 teams. Idk
   what's reasonable given I have no idea how many teams have entered,
   but I expect high quality ultimate from all of us

3. I like the idea of a write up. I found it useful to revisit what
   I'd learnt and the focus of the team's if we were playing poorly or
   needed to re focus. As for out of towners, maybe a weekly POD for
   them to do, whether it be drills, throws etc
4. That's fair enough but I do think there should be training
   expectations. - e.g.you are expected to train an additional 2 X
   sessions of whatever you want in your own time. I also think a
   Facebook page with weekly 'week 1 - post your sweaty selfies'
   should be used. It was very ehlpful at maintaining motivation
   during the stingrays campaign
5. I won't be at the training camp, I told Annie before Christmas, I
   hope that's okay. Sorry 🙁
6. No injuries. Sadly no jokes (please keep the no jokes bit
   confidential 😉 )
** DONE Mon
1. Always look forward to international tournaments and great
   opportunity to be playing in Wollongong colors over there.
2. Understand we have a range of skills, so want us to play the best
   we can, gel as a team and come away from all if not most games
   happy with how we all played.
*** Hidden                                                         :noexport:
4. We are grateful to play with Wollongong as we know training
   together regularly would be difficult. It would be good to have a
   Sydney pod going if possible to get a bit of cohesion. Team
   trainings that have a lot of games, such as scrimmages might
   benefit. Have to trust individuals to work on basic skills in their
   own time (or in pods).
5. Following from above and definitely keen to see programs. I'm
   nursing niggles and some injuries but they are currently
   manageable - just need time and commitment to do those rehab
   exercises.
6. Yes
7. Just my two cents. I think having a level headed coach like
   yourself will be beneficial. Balance between playing
   'instinctively' and having structure. Drilling bad habits out and
   good habits in, learning each other's playing style and playing to
   our strengths.

Heya Maggi, thanks for checking in! Not really sure what the selectors
told you but I am very unlikely to actually be playing WUCC as I have
more surgeries to come this year. I think I was selected as a
placeholder for someone else with a more functional body! Sorry this
isn't very helpful for your planning but basically I can be factored
out of most of your thinking

3. I’ll be playing nats with manly so I’ll have a pretty intense
   regime anyway. I think just keeping up to date with what’s
   happening with the team would be helpful.
4. Sounds awesome - also got a training plan for manly but will
   definitely reach out if something comes up
5. I’ll try - it’s a little tricky with covid atm and I’m living with
   my parents in Sydney so I’m trying to limit risk to them
6. Recovering for ankle injury last month - just doing rehab atm
** DONE Rachel
1. I want to push myself really hard and improve my fitness and
   playing ability so that by the time the tournament comes around, I
   will be putting my absolute best foot forward, for myself and the
   team. I wanted to play in this team to be able to experience a
   different calibre of ultimate with my friends and also because
   Stingrays got cancelled. I can’t wait to feel a part of a strong
   and united team and ultimately have a lot of fun.
2. I hope the team is able to find a healthy balance of hard work and
   good vibes. I am hoping for a competitive team where every
   individual is working hard, for themselves and for the rest of the
   team. Working hard for each other is something I believe success
   will be everyone walking off after the last game believing they did
   the best they could, and feeling like an integral part of the team.
   Any other success is a cherry on top.

1. On a personal level: I want to improve as an individual ultimate
   player and as a member of the Wollongong Ultimate community. I am
   especially excited for this opportunity since Bluebottles got
   cancelled last year! I also want to have A LOT of fun (on the field
   especially)!
2. On a team level: I value success as everyone buying into the team
   and having the same shared interest in the team. I don’t care what
   the scores of our games are as long as we are playing our
   collective best as a team. I would like to think we can do this and
   have a really fun time knowing that we are challenging ourselves
   and playing our best ultimate.

3. WUCC training: I think it would be beneficial to have a short write
   up of the sessions for out of towners so they can adapt it. I think
   an emphasis on the focus/skill of the session would be helpful,
   then these players can take this focus into their club/ individual
   training as well.
4. Individual training program: Yes, I’d be interested in setting up
   an individual training program. I have some resources from the
   bluebottles camp but would love to get your opinion on it!
5. I sadly will most likely not be able to attend the training camp.
   My housemate tested positive on a rap test for covid yesterday and
   we both have symptoms. Waiting for a PCR test to confirm! Will let
6. Additional stuff: I have a sore ankle right now but should be
   nothing to worry about, am managing it fine! Other than that am
   SUPER KEEN for everything you have planned! 🤪

1. This is going to be my first international tournament and I’m
   hoping to become a confident player through this opportunity. I’d
   like to improve not only my skills but also my knowledge/mental
   strength (in the game) etc.. and eventually boost my confidence
   level.
2. I don’t have a clear answer for this yet... It’s probably because I
   don't know the team yet and also it’s my first time playing this
   high level tournament. I think maybe I’ll get a better idea of what
   to expect a bit later?

3. I have club team training 2 days / week and do some pods with team
   mates 1–2 days / week. I also play NSU league (2 games on Monday)
   and even though it’s not training, it's a good place for me to try
   things that I work on to improve. I think it’d be very helpful if
   you could share what you did/what was the focus in each session.
4. I have a 2 days a week conditioning/strength session at gym (not
   frisbee specific), but I’d like to add some fitness sessions
   (something like agility drills) that I can do on my own. If you
   could share some ideas for that, that’d be great
5. I will be there. But maybe leaving a bit early (3pm ish) on

** DONE Thea
1. I signed up for this campaign for the opportunity to be a part of a
   team of likeminded and driven people. International campaigns (from
   my limited experience) are tough, but the connections built through
   that collective hard work are like nothing else and that’s what’s
   really valuable for me! Also for the chance to challenge myself-
   put everything into a campaign with people I enjoying playing fris
   with and see what we can achieve:)
2. I want to see buy in, like Boothy was saying. I want to be a part
   of a team that is committed to the training, to the connections and
   building something that we can all be proud of, knowing that we all
   gave what we could and came off better for it. This is going to be
   one of the biggest financial commitments I’ve made on my own so far
   so I’m not here to fuck around lol.

3. Having other bonding events like zoom chats or getting together
   when we can outside of physical trainings!! I think this is
   especially important with the unpredictability of covid. I like
   write ups of sessions - good for reflection and being able to
   measure progress.
4. I’d definitely be interested in gym and conditioning programs!! I
   also think with the individual training side of things that running
   pods/ sharing training updates on whatever medium is a really good
   way of showing/encouraging buy in, and gives the team the chance to
   really get around each other:)
5. Yes!

group chat about commitment and prioritizing because it appears people
are pretty annoyed that I can’t make the training camp because of my

** DONE Kevin
1. When I filled out the EOI, I honestly did not really expect to make
   the team…I thought it would be an awesome chance to play some
   high-level ultimate frisbee and build some relationships as I am
   moving to Wollongong for a new job this year. On a personal level I
   have the most fun playing ultimate when I and everyone else is
   playing at a high level and points are competitive. Playing at WUCC
   would be an opportunity to play such highly competitive and high
   level frisbee. Furthermore, I am also really excited to be part of
   a group who are similarly committed and to push each other to
   improve.
2. I think the first and most important part of the team’s success is
   in how we prepare. For me it’s probably harder to juggle priorities
   and make time for all extra training required than the actual
   training itself (personally I love playing and training hard). I
   think a successful campaign is one where everyone has maximised
   their commitment to train. I am not experienced enough to really
   know what a good placing at WUCC would be, but once the tournament
   is over, I feel like we will know if we had performed to our
   ability.

3. I trust between you and the out of towners we can keep them honest
   and feeling like part of the team. I dont have any ideas currently
4. From what I've heard for Jono and Aidan we will already have this
   sorted for mens
5.Wouldnt miss it for the world! 6.Eating too much cake is the sin of
Gluttony, however eating too much pie is ok because the sin of pi is

1. On a personal level, I am psyched to play a WUCC campaign with
   Wollongong. I plan on pushing myself more than I ever really have
   and look forward to matching with some of the best over in the
   states.
2. On a team level, I am hoping for some wins of course but I think
   success would be finding our best level of play and then showing it
   with reasonable consistency at the tournament.

3. For me, I will probably be making one trip a week to Wollongong and
   I can look at alternating mixed and open for that, however it is a
   long drive for a 60 min session. I plan on running fitness based
   sessions for myself twice a week and body weight workouts 3 times
   in addition to league twice a week. I do have a routine ripped from
   GPP but It would still be great to see what the team is training
   each week so I can look at mirroring it.
4. As above I guess?
5. Yes, we will be there.
6. A personal note that I am excited to have you as a coach especially
   because of your time playing outside of Wollongong. The team has my
   heart but I can get frustrated with the over reliance on individual
   players to "just get free" rather than systems especially around
   the dump space. That's not to say that it's a Wollongong specific
   problem but I hope with your time playing at Groot you might have a
   fresh perspective on that.
Looking forward to seeing you next weekend!

1. To me WUCC was always something I saw as unachievable, I didn’t
   have the commitment or drive to get there, or I never really put
   the effort into Ultimate as I did other sports. With this
   opportunity and the physical ability and health I am currently at I
   would like to see how far I can push myself and truly improve and
   learn. The ability to be surrounded by such a higher level gives me
   inspiration to hopefully perform and hold my own.
2. On a team level, I want success to be both on everyone’s individual
   focuses, through their growth and development as players. But also,
   I want to see one cohesive team, everyone at the same level and
   striving for everyone to be there both spiritually and physically.

3. I like the idea of the Extra WUCC training, have no real ideas for
   out of towners
4.  I am looking to continue and vastly improve my fitness habits,
   although one thing that does limit me is my lack of guidance or
   structure, I would be quite interested in something on top of the
   current proof for booth if it is an option,
5. My current plan is yes, I will be there, however at the time of
   sending this Wednesday 5th of Jan, one of my housemates Is
   currently awaiting a negative PCR test after having high symptoms
   and testing positive on a RAT. This makes me a close contact
   (morally, technically not til they receive PCR) so if they happen
   to be negative, I will be there.
6. Apart from the ever-present ankle frustration no other injuries,
   always on the look out for more ankle strengthening techniques and
   skills.
** DONE Matt
1. I want to have a great time but I also want to perform really well
   on an individual and team level and get fitter than I've ever been.
   I'm looking forward to having a big goal to motivate me. I signed
   up because I love playing frisbee and have a lot of fun doing it.
2. Of course I'd love to win games but I think that everyone playing
   their best individually and as a team is more important even if we
   don't win tons. I want the team to have a great/fun vibe while
   simultaneously everyone is still really focused on playing our
   best. I hope the team will have a really positive, supportive
   culture

1. Enjoyable experience with my friends playing the sport I love.
   Wouldn't have gone with a non-wollongong team.
2. Be competitive. No goal on placements but I don't want to go over
   there just for the fun of it. Nationals is fun and a lot closer.

   vicinity? Not sure if this is possible.
4. proofforbooth.com got me sorted. Here's hoping people can be left
   to manage themselves successfully.

1. Fun, good memories and new friends.
2. I want success not to be results driven. I'd rather place 50th and
   be happy with how the team controlled our game than place 9th and
   not be proud of our performances. I’d like our goals to be based on
   things we can control and measure, regardless of who we’re playing
   against or what the score is.

3. When I’m in God’s country I’ll be able to train with Krank men and
   mixed hopefully every session. I’m still looking for work so that’s
   a big unknown for me. I’ll let you know if my job impacts training
   at all.
4. I haven’t been as fit as I’d like to be for a very long time. I
   have had a bunch of injuries in the last few years. When I’m in
   Gong I’d like to figure out how to get me in good shape for July. I
   might try and buddy up with people and tag along to their fitness
   pods and see how I go from there.
5. I’m unable to go this weekend, I’m going up the coast with Holly,
   sorry!
6. I’m keen to help in non playing roles too, happy to chat about
   session plans and objectives if you ever want to bounce some ideas
   around.
** DONE Coby
1. I'm hoping to get an overseas frisbee experience and also this may
   be my first chance to have a centralish role on the team
2. Jaydens thrown around the idea of being in the top half of mixed
   teams. While it'd be nice I'm quite happy just to form a cohesive
   team that has chemistry on and off field so that we're always
   having fun.

3. Maybe we have a training in Sydney at some point but I don't have
   any ideas for canberra people. Unless people are keen on just a
   zoom theory session, we did these for goeys and it worked
   suprisingly well, however i think the demographic of the group may
   not be as keen
4. Currently working of p4b and the leftover goeys stuff. Anything
   else you have for conditioning would be greatly appreciated
5. Yes
6. Rehabbing knee and shoulder, should be an issue I cane resolve
   within the next 3 weeks.

What do you call a chicken with a lettuce leaf on its head?
** DONE Arun
1. I have recently re-found a bit of the passion I once had for
   frisbee. It has been a fluctuating relationship with frisbee in the
   years I've played but more recently I have felt like I want to
   reinvest my self into it. I guess my goals were initially to just
   reimmerse my self into the world and get to a point of performing
   at a high level again. Nationals was the goal to feel that, but
   WUCC serves the same purpose.
2. I'll be honest in that I'm not expecting us to go an win the whole
   thing... But that is always a goal of sport in itself. But I guess
   I want us to be able to represent krank to a high standard and show
   Australia aswell as clubs around the world we deserve to play there
   and can play at a high level.

3. Not so sure, it's hard... Probably videos? With explanations of
   whatever it is we are working on so it can be contextualised for
   out of towners. Not sure. I'll keep thinking.
4. I will maybe take you up on that, but I do plan on working on
   things that I have wanted to work on.
5. Yes.
6. Yes, I have been battling injuries, a knee niggle and a back niggle
   at present. Working with a physio to get into op of it, and have
   voiced my goals to him of wanting to play at a high level. These
   niggles are also unfortunately something I battle with and can lose
   motivation from at times, so I'm trying to address them early and
   build up to not having to worry about them.

1. I want to improve as much as I can and be involved in a campaign

3. My training will be 2 field sessions with Fyshwick plus our gym and
   running programs. When will the trainings be? I would like to try
   and make to some of them if I can. I think from an out of town
   perspective I want to know what our priorities are on O and D and
   what structures or styles we are going to play. I think a write up
   would be helpful.
4. We have a strength coach for Fyshwick so I will be following that.

** DONE Initial survey
SCHEDULED: <2022-01-03 Mon>

Hi XXX,

Hope you've been having a good summer. Annie, Mandy and Jayden have asked me to coach the WUCC team in the lead up to the tournament. I'm unlikely to travel with the team to the US, so my job will be more to do with running trainings rather than holding clipboards.

Just doing a little survey before this weekend's training camp to get an idea of where people are at. A bit of a response to each question would be great.

1. What are you hoping to get out of the experience on a personal level/why did you sign up?

2. What are you hoping for on a team level/what do you want success for the team to look like?

3. From now until April the plan is to hold one WUCC training a week (knowing that everyone will also be training a couple of times a week with their nationals clubs). To help manage workload/recovery these will likely be short, focused sessions, probably 60 minutes. For players that can't attend (living outside God's country) do you have any ideas on what your training might look like? Would it be helpful for me to send out a quick write up of the session each week for you to adapt it? Any ideas on how we can include out of towners in training? This is something I think will be a challenge, but it important to get right, so keen to hear ideas.

4. Not planning to prescribe any fitness/strength training, with the expectation that people understand their own bodies and how to manage this aspect of training. That being said, I have access to professionally developed ulti specific training programs for both gym and conditioning/fitness. If you'd like some guidance or help setting up a program in this area let me know.

5. Will you be there for this weekend's training camp (8-9th Jan)? 11am-4pm Sat, 10:30-4pm Sun, I'll send out a schedule in the next few days.

6. Finally, anything that might be relevent for me to know (current injuries, only playing if you don't get a call up from the crocs, anecdotes, interesting jokes)? Will remain confidential where required.
** DONE Message about elite/worlds standard

Hey team,

I've been reflecting on everyone's responses to their personal goals and one of the consistent themes is that people want to take their ultimate to the next level. There's a certain calibre that we think of when we imagine a Worlds level player and it's exciting to see so many people coming together at the same time to strive for that.

I've put some thought into how to run the trainings to bring people to that level. I'll be doing my best to run some good sessions and the leadership team is working hard behind the scenes to set up opportunities throughout the season, but there's no way that I, or anyone else, can turn you into a worlds player. That responsibility lies with yourself.

In order to take your game to the next level you have to take ownership of your own journey. There's no set syllabus or recipe to follow, and no one is going to do it for you.

Some of the advice that I would like to offer in this space is:

- Make the most of trainings. Think a lot about what we are doing, and why. Approach drills and exercises mindfully so you can get the most out of your time spent training. Make sure you learn and understand team structures. Show up on time ready to go and prepared for the conditions.

- Practice consistently. Great if you are keen and motivated one week, but consistency over the whole 6 month campaign will be crucial to improving as a player. My advice is to physically write out a training program/schedule/calendar and stick to it, rather than winging it and doing what you feel like. This should apply to fitness, skills/drills, mental strength, everything.

- Learn from other players around you. There's a lot of experience within the team and the larger Wollongong community that you should be drawing from. We have players like Tim who's been through more than 40 worlds campaigns and knows a thing or two. We have players like Mandy and Coby who have been through plenty of youth campaigns. We have worlds players like Rosie, and Steph hanging out in Wollongong. We have Alex H who went to the last WUCC in Cincinatti with Christchurch. There's Jono who knows some stuff about modern elite ultimate. We have international experience in Gemma and Andy. That's just to scratch the surface.

- Surround yourself with others that have the same goal as you. This is one of the things that you might get for free being part of this team, so make the most of it. Train together, run pods together, watch game footage together, brush your teeth together.

Excited to see the team step up to the next level over the next few months. Remember that everyone here is in it together and if you ever need support you just need to ask.


On a related note, there was a lot of interest in ultimate specific gym and fitness training. Rather than respond individually, I'll include it in this message. I strongly encourage everyone on the team to look into joining a program. The two I know of are the Ultimate Athlete Program (UAP) and GamePoint Performance (GPP). I have done a season of UAP before and will post up some of the pdfs from when I did it so you can see what it looks like. Don't know much about GPP, but have a chat to Drew or Jono, pretty sure they've used it. If anyone else has any recommendations, make sure to speak up.

UAP pdfs: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16Hh2vh0CUSC4cZo65C4ZsbdyW9Qtj-xf?usp=sharing

6 months isn't a heap of time if you're new to gym stuff, but I can guarantee you'll see some pretty massive results in that time regardless. You should be looking to put in 4-5 sessions a week. Key is to start light and get your technique perfect with the gym stuff, and go crazy with the conditioning/core stuff. If you wanted to go the cheapskate option you can use the pdfs. The trick will be deciding which phases to do in the lead up (I can help with that from my limited experience if you ask) and doing the research on proper technique for weighted exercises. Would recommend though that you just pull together some money and properly sign up. Gives you access to all the instructional videos, apps, and an extra sense of accountability. Maybe team up and do a cost share with someone if the cost is a barrier or you want to save some money for your weekly avocado toast.

TLDR: Take personal responsibility for your development = guaranteed to become worlds calibre player, never fails.
